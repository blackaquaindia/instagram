<hr>

<h4>Step One</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>If you’re planning to use Instagram in a commercial, show or film, submit the pertinent part of the script along with the Instagram asset mocked up as you’d like to use it.</li>
 	<li>We may ask to see your entire script if the use isn’t clear. For animation, submit your script, digital storyboards and business development paintings.</li>
 	<li>Please only use the <a onclick="window.navigateWithReactRouterTo(&quot;https://en.instagram-brand.com/assets&quot;)">approved assets</a>.When you first submit your request, we should get back to you within two to three weeks.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Step Two</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Once your script and mock are approved and you’ve finalized your creative, submit the near-final version of our asset in your film.</li>
 	<li>For animation, upload the final clip once animation is complete.</li>
 	<li>Once you submit your finalized creative/revised creative, we should get back to you within two to three weeks.</li>
 	<li>Remember that it may take longer than two to three weeks to get approval. You may need to revise your creative and resubmit your request if it doesn’t follow our guidelines. Approvals are not final until you have it in writing.</li>
